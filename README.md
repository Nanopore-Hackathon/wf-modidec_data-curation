# wf-ModiDeC (Part 1: data curation)

## Introduction
In this directory you find part 1 of the code from ModiDec. The scripts located in ./bin facilitate the data curation. ...

### Functionality Overview
Below is a graphical overview of suggested routes through the pipeline depending on the desired output.

## Issues to be fixed
- Solving conda environment failed on MacOS M1
- 

## Questions: 
- How does the matching between the pod5 and the bam file work? Based on name? if so on which part of the name? etc.


## Quick Start
Test run the code:

1. Install [`Miniconda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

2. Download the pipeline from Github
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nanopore-Hackathon/wf-modidec_data-curation.git
    ```

3. Install and activate conda environemnt
    ```bash
    conda env create -f ./envs/remora_TF2_env.yml
    conda activate remora_TF2
    ```

4. Start running the data curation by using the following command 
    ```bash
    python ./bin/Resquigle_remora_GUI.py
    ```


## Hackathone Tasks
Key aim: Convert the scripts into a Nextflow pipleine compatible with Epi2Me.

Main Tasks: 
1. Get your system up and ready
    - Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=23.10.0`)

    - Install [`Docker`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

    - Install [`Epi2Me Desktop`](https://labs.epi2me.io) (v5.1.14 or later)

    - Clone the Github repository (we recommend the GitHub Desktop client)

2. Translate the functions and logic into Nextflow processes and ultimately a Nextflow pipeline

3. Convert the GUI into nextflow_schema.json format

4. Containerise and deploy the Coda evenvirnemnet using Docker

5. Test and debug pipeline in Epi2Me using test data
