## Quick Start
Test run the code:

1. Install [`Miniconda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

2. Download the pipeline from Github

3. Start running the data curation by using the following command 


## Hackathone Tasks
Key aim: Convert the scripts into a Nextflow pipleine compatible with Epi2Me.

1. Get your system up and ready
    - Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=23.10.0`)
    - Install [`Miniconda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

    - Install [`Docker`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

    - Install [`Epi2Me Desktop`](https://labs.epi2me.io) (v5.1.14 or later)

    - Clone the Github repository (we recommend the GitHub Desktop client)

2. Translate the functions and logic into Nextflow processes and ultimately a Nextflow pipeline

3. Convert the GUI into nextflow_schema.json format

4. Containerise and deploy the Coda evenvirnemnet using Docker

5. Test and debug pipeline in Epi2Me using test data
